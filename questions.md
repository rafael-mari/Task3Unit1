# Homework: Questions

### Why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?

A developer who is good at both low-level and high-level programming would normally use a high-level language when writing programs because it is easier to understand since it employs the common English language, and therefore, the process of writing and debugging programs is way faster than it would be in a low-level language. It allows programmers to write more complexed assignment statements. Programs in a high-level language are also easier to read and maintain by the programmers.

### What is machine code?

Machine code is the main language that computers use, because they do not understand the language that human speaks. This kind of code, also called machine language, uses bits, which are composed only by zeros and ones, ergo, it uses binary language. Assembly language needs to be translated into machine code for computers to understand it.

### Give an example of a high-level language

An example of this kind of language is Python. It is a popular general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. Due to its ubiquity and ability to run on nearly every system architecture, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications.

### Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?

 - High-level language employs the common English language while the low-level language employs mnemonics if we are talking about assembly language or binary if we are talking about machine code.
 - High-level language needs to be translated by either a compiler or an interpreter, while the low-level language needs to be translated by an assembler if we are talking about assembly language. On the other hand, if we talk about machine code, it can be produced either by a compiler, interpreter or assembler.
 - In high-level language we are able to construct complex conditional statements by using Boolean operations such as AND, OR and NOT, while in low-level languages we canâ€™t do it.

### What does a translator do?

A translator is a programming language processor that converts a computer program from one language to another.  It takes a program written in source code and converts it into machine code for computers to understand it. It also discovers and identifies the error during translation.

### Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code

 - One type of translator that can turn high-level languages into machine code is the compiler. It converts the whole program in one single session and reports the detected errors after the conversion is done. Compiler takes time to do its work as it translates all at once and then saves it to memory.
 - Another type of translator that can do it is the interpreter. It converts the program one at a time and reports errors detected at once, while doing the conversion.  With this, it is easier to detect errors than in a compiler. An interpreter is faster than a compiler as it immediately executes the code upon reading the code.

### What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

The main difference between this two kinds of translators is that a compiler translates the whole program at the same time to produce the executable object code, while the interpreter does both actions, translating and executing, one line at the time. Another difference is that compilers are faster since with the interpreters each instruction needs to be translated before executing it.

### What is assembly language?

This language, also known as assembly code, is a kind of low-level language which uses mnemonics, text commands that come from abbreviations of English words. Assembly code can be converted to machine code using an assembler, which is a type of translator. Assembly language provides human-understandable substitutions for long strings of binary code.

### A developer is writing a program.

#### The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?

High-level language uses the common English to make it easy to understand, while machine code uses binary language to be understood by the computers.

Machine code needs to be produced by either by a compiler, assembler or interpreter, while high-level language needs to be translated either by a compiler or an interpreter.

### One type of translator is an interpreter.

#### Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?

An interpreter is used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language. The programming language translates the source code one line at the time into machine code, it reports errors detected at once, while doing the conversion. After the translation is done, the interpreter immediately executes them.

#### State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?

The other type of translator that can translate high-level code into machine code is the compiler. Unlike the interpreter, a compiler converts the whole program in a single session, and at the end, it shows all the errors detected during the conversion.
